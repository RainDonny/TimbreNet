# Dataset
Opencpop dataset can be found through https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ouBulY56Mj58tFYbiM_t2ES4UsRUKCsg?usp=share_link
M4Singer is large, maybe you could just download a few of them through https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xC37E59EWRRFFLdG3aJkVqwtLDgtFNqW/view

# Notice
The preprocessing task can be replaced by
Opencpop: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19FueE7TjPM6ZnwIqupGOaYTtJXlkvOz8?usp=share_link
M4Singer: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EnhbjEKK4O8vWR1qiD2JdtHMDFdXDSQc?usp=share_link
You need to extract 'the whole two folders' (Opencpop and M4Singer) into 'preprocess' folder.
After this, you could jump to training period by running run_training.sh.
